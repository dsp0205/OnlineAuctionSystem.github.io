<p>  . </p>
<h2> Bidding and using AutoBid </h2> 

<p> Users can place bids by manually clicking the relevant bid button or using the automatic AutoBid function, when activated. </p> 
<p> AutoBid lets users bid on an auction even when they are not online or logged in. The AutoBid automatically places bids according to the user’s instructions. For more information on AutoBid, visit the "FAQs" section. </p> 
<p> Bids are purchased in advance in the form of "Bid Packs". Haraaj.in reserves the right to offer different size Bid Packs at different times; also, Haraaj.in could offer free bids at its sole discretion. All placed bids and free bids are non-refundable. All unused credits are non refundable and non transferable. </p> 
<p>  . </p>
<h2> How the Auctions Work </h2> 

 <p> With each bid placed, the price of the item on which the user is bidding increases by a small preset amount (10 INR to 100 INR). Each new bid resets the remaining time for an auction up to the amount specified for the Auction Type (usually 10, 20, 30, 50, and 60 Minutes or up to 24 Hours as specified for that particular auction). All set by the Seller. </p> 
<p> When a bid is placed, number of credits are deducted from the user’s bidding account as per the specified number of credits for that auction. Or after successful bidding, the Bidder will be taken to a Payment Gateway to pay their Bid Amount. Placed bids are not refundable. An auction closes when no more bids are received by Haraaj.in’ servers. The countdown time is indicated for each auction. Due to the time it takes for bids to reach Haraaj.in’ servers, and in order to allow all users the same opportunity to bid regardless of geographic location, Haraaj.in’ servers will wait for an additional 5 seconds for any placed bids to reach Haraaj.in servers before closing the auction. </p> 
 <p> The user who was the last to place a bid wins the auction and can purchase the product. </p> 
 <p> Bids become valid when they are entered in the Haraaj.in database and registered in Haraaj.in’ system. Haraaj.in is not responsible for disruptions in the user’s connection and errors that may occur as a result of this. This includes, but is not limited to, incorrect countdown of the remaining time, outdated information on bidders, and bids. </p> 
<p>  . </p>
 <h2> Buy Now Option  </h2> 
 <p> We may, at our sole discretion, also offer users a "Buy Now" option. The Buy Now option allows a user to buy the auctioned product using up to 89% of the value of the bids already spent in that auction. It gives the user the option to purchase the product by paying the difference between the value of the spent bids in that auction and the product value, which is the suggested retail price. The user may only use the value of the bids he/she has placed in the auction up to the product value. If the value of the placed bids is higher than the product value, then the bids in excess of the product value cannot be used in a Buy Now purchase. The value of any bids spent above the value of the product will not be refunded. The Buy Now purchase price can never be zero or below zero. The user can buy the product using the Buy Now option at any time when the auction is online and up to 24 hours after the auction has closed. When a user decides to buy the product by exercising the Buy Now option, he/she may no longer participate in the auction, any AutoBids that have been placed in that auction will be cancelled and the remaining AutoBid bids returned to the user’s bid account. The auction will continue uninterrupted for all other users. All purchases pursuant to a Buy Now option shall be subject to the user’s payment in full of all amounts due for the product (including all shipping and handling charges) within 24 hours after the auction ends. Unless payment is received in full within this time, the user’s right and Buy Now option to purchase and receive the product is automatically withdrawn and cancelled, and the user shall not be entitled to a refund of any bids placed. </p> 
<p>  . </p>
 <h2> Acceptance of the Win - Payment </h2> 
 <p> Once an auction is closed, the winner, goes to My Account for information on the total price, including shipping costs, and payment options. Once the auction is closed, the winner has to pay same day the total price of the product through provided Payment Gateway, by following the steps indicated on the website. After confirming the win and paying the amount due, the winner will receive a confirmation e-mail. Seller will ship the product within 24 Hours after payment confirmation is received. Shipping (receiving & delivery of the product) will be handled by Shipping Agent that will be integrated into Haraaj.in Website. </p> 
 <p> The buyer must also provide an accurate delivery address on the account, before Haraaj.in can ship the product. After Haraaj.in has shipped the product, it will take a few days for it to reach the buyer. </p> 
  <p> If an auction win has not been confirmed and paid within 3 days, the order will be void and cancelled, spent bids will not be refunded. </p> 
<p>  . </p>
 <h2> Delivery </h2> 
 <p> Unless otherwise specified, delivery will be made from our Seller’s Registered Address to the registered address provided by the Buyer.
Deliveries are made solely within India. </p> 
 <p> As Haraaj.in works with trusted delivery partners to ensure the best possible service and widest reach, all delivery estimates are for information only and do not constitute binding agreements. Obvious damage to the item or packaging during transit should be reported to the carrier by the winning Buyer, if the item is damaged it should be refused, not signed for. If you wish to claim for concealed defects or damage after signing for an item, you must inform us about the damaged or faulty goods within 24 Hours of receipt. Haraaj.in cannot accept responsibility for damaged or faulty goods once 24 Hours have lapsed. In all cases you must inspect your item either at the point of or immediately after delivery. Failure to raise a query with Haraaj.in, concerning a damaged or incorrect item within 24 Hours of delivery constitutes acceptance of the item as is. Haraaj.in does not accept liability for damage or failure of products due to neglect or misuse by the recipient. In the event that Haraaj.in’s delivery partners are not able to deliver the item within a reasonable time, Haraaj.in shall be entitled to offer the winning User a substitute item with comparable or better features, or to set aside the contract through remission and offer a refund of any payments received for the auction item. This does not affect the User’s statutory rights. </p> 
<p>  . </p>
 <h2 id="Refund"> Refund & Cancellation </h2> 
 <p> The product will be delivered to the address specified by the user. 
Since Haraaj.in mainly deals in Used Products, no warranty is provided to any products. 
If the Seller fails to deliver Bid Product to the Buyer for any reason, the Buyer is entitled for full Refund. </p> 
 <p> The Seller gets paid against the Bid Product only after the Buyer receives the Bid Product. </p> 
 <p> All technical service and product support matters of any new products if any must be taken up directly with the manufacturer according to their terms. In case of cancellation of an order, only the purchase price will be refunded. So, shipping costs and spent bids will never be refunded. This policy applies both to auctions and Buy Now option.

 <p> TERMINATION BY HARAAJ.IN : </p> 
 <p> Haraaj.in reserves the right to temporarily or permanently terminate Your account at its sole discretion if it determines You have violated these Terms & Conditions, any laws, or the rights of our other users or other third parties.
